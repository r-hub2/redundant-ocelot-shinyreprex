#' @description
#' When reproducing a reactive object, a step is required to get the environment that
#' the reactive was assigned in, rather than the environment that is calling `shiny_reprex`.
#' For that, some diving into the internals of the observable object is required to
#' get the specific environment, before generating the reproducible code.
#'
#' ## Environments
#' The `Observable` object attached to the given reactive is extracted. Within the
#' `Observable`, the `.origFunc` contains the environment that the reactive expression
#' was created - the parent environment being the module that the reactive is assigned
#' in. This allows the variables in the module to be found and set as pre-requisites
#' for the given reactive.
#'
#' If `bindCache` or `bindEvent` are used, then the environment found is the call within
#' the relevant function. To get to the module environment, we find that the `reactive`
#' is assigned as "`wrappedFunc`", so that is used to find the module environment.
